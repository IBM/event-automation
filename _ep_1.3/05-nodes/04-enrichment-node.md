## Enrichment from a database

In situations where the data in the source table might not offer significant insights on its own, establishing connections with external databases and integrating their data can yield a more comprehensive result.

With the database node, you can retrieve data from external databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle) and integrate the data with the events within your workflow. 

**Note:** {{site.data.reuse.ep_name}} can be configured to connect to a [secure PostgreSQL or MySQL database or Oracle](../../installing/configuring/#configuring-ssl-for-api-server-database-and-schema-registry). Contact your system administrator if you encounter issues while configuring the database node to communicate with a secure PostgreSQL, MySQL, or an Oracle database.

### Adding a database node

To add a database node, complete the following steps.

1. {{site.data.reuse.node_step1}}
2. In the **Palette**, under **Enrichment**, drag the **Database** node into the canvas.
3. {{site.data.reuse.node_connect}} A purple checkbox ![unconfigured_node icon]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/unconfigured_node.svg "Diagram showing the unconfigured node icon."){: height="30px" width="15px"} is displayed on the database node indicating that the node is yet to be configured.

4. Hover over the node and click ![Edit icon]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/rename.svg "The edit icon."){:height="30px" width="15px"} **Edit** to configure the node.

The **Configure database enrichment** window appears.

### Configuring a database node

To configure a database node, complete the following steps.

1. {{site.data.reuse.node_details}}
1. In the **Connect to database**, enter the URL of the secured database.

   PostgreSQL example:

   ```sql
   jdbc:postgresql://<host>:<port>/<database>?<configuration>
   ```

   MySQL example:

   ```sql
   jdbc:mysql://<host>:<port>/<database>?<configuration>
   ```

   Oracle example:

   ```sql
   jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=<protocol>)(PORT=<port>)(HOST=<host>))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=<service_name>)))
   ```

   Where:

   - `<host>` is the hostname of the database server.
   - `<port>` is the port number of the database server.
   - `<database>` is the name of the database that contains the table to be used for enrichment.
   - `<configuration>` is the list of configuration parameters for the connection.
   - `<protocol>` is used in order to activate SSL in the JDBC thin client.
   - `<service_name>` is used by the database to register itself with a listener. 
1. Click **Next** to open the **Access Credentials** pane. Enter your username and password (if prompted).
1. Click **Next**. The **Table selection** pane is displayed.
1. To choose a table from the provided database, you can either search for the table name in the search box, or select the radio button corresponding to the table name that you want to process events from.

   **Important:** {{site.data.reuse.ep_name}} supports:
   - Lowercase names for tables and columns in PostgreSQL databases
   - Uppercase names for tables and columns in Oracle databases

1. A preview of the schema of the selected table, along with its associated constraints, is displayed in the **Data table preview**. Click **Next**.

   **Note:** In the **Data table preview**, some data types under the **Type** column are listed as **Not supported**. These data types are not supported by {{site.data.reuse.ep_name}} and the corresponding fields cannot be used to enrich events.

   The following data types in the remote database table are supported by {{site.data.reuse.ep_name}}:

   | `VARCHAR`           | ✓          |       | ✓      |

1. In the **Match Criteria** pane, define your expression by using the property from the source, and the table field.

   For example, the incoming event has a field `country_code` with values such as `866, 453, 123` and you wish to lookup a human readable name from a database table.

   The match criteria is used as the join condition between the event and the database table.

   ```transparent
   event.country_code = database_table.country_code
   ```

   **Note:** Ensure the expressions contain an equality condition.
   Alternatively, you can use the assistant to create an expression. Select **Assistant** at the right end of the text-box to open the assistant. The assistant offers two separate drop-down lists of properties, for the source table attributes and the database table attributes with constraints, enabling you to construct the expression.

   {{site.data.reuse.ep_treeview_note}}

1. After you defined an expression, click **Next** to open the **Enrich Properties** pane. Include or reject the database table fields for further processing.
1. Click **Next** to open the **Output properties** pane, which contains both the input fields from the preceding node, and the previously chosen database table fields. Remove the fields that you do not want to be visible in the output.

   **Note:** To rename properties, hover over a property, and click the **Edit** icon ![Edit icon]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/rename.svg "The edit icon."){:height="30px" width="15px"}.
1. Scroll down and click **Configure** to complete the configuration.

A green checkbox ![green checkbox]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/checkbox_green.svg "Icon showing a green checkbox."){:height="30px" width="15px"} appears on the database node if the database node is configured correctly. If there is any error in your configuration, a red checkbox ![red checkbox]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/errornode.svg "Icon showing a red checkbox."){:height="30px" width="15px"} appears.

User actions are [saved](../../getting-started/canvas/#save) automatically. For save status updates, see the canvas header.


## Enrichment from an API

In situations where the data in the source table might not offer significant insights on its own, making calls to external APIs and integrating data from the API responses can yield a more comprehensive result.

### Prerequisites and limitations

To configure the API node, ensure you upload an OpenAPI document that meets the following requirements:

 - OpenAPI specification 3.0 or 3.1 is required.
 - At least one [server URL](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/){:target="_blank"} with the `http` or `https` protocol is required. Relative URLs or server templating are not supported. For URLs that use the `https` protocol, ensure you [configure](../../installing/configuring/#configuring-ssl-for-api-server-database-and-schema-registry) Flink and {{site.data.reuse.ep_name}} to enable SSL connections.
 - At least one `GET` or `POST` [operation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/paths-and-operations/){:target="_blank"} is required with the following requirements:
    - The operation uses one of the following [security methods](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/){:target="_blank"}: basic authentication, API keys (in the header or query parameter), or no authentication (None).
    - Has the [media type](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/media-types/){:target="_blank"} `application/json` for the response (`GET` and `POST`) and the request body (`POST`).
    - Body parameters and API responses of type `array` with primitive types (`string`, `number`, `integer`, and `boolean`) and complex types (`array`, `object`) are supported.
    

    - Required query parameters of type `array` are not supported. However, the operation can still define optional query parameters of type `array`, but these parameters are not made available for configuring the API node.
    - Defines at least one [parameter](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-parameters/){:target="_blank"} of the kind `query` or `path`, or has at least one non-array property defined in the schema of the [request body](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-request-body/){:target="_blank"}.
    - For [parameter serialization](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/serialization/){:target="_blank"} of query parameters, the `style` attribute is either set to the `form` style, or no `style` attribute is specified, and for path parameters, the `style` attribute is either set to the `simple` style, or no `style` attribute is specified.

The API enrichment in {{site.data.reuse.ep_name}} has the following limitations:

- Only `GET` and `POST` operations are supported for API enrichment.
- Only the supported API parameters are available to configure the API node.
- A single API node can only support one API operation. Chain multiple API nodes together to support multiple API operations.
- If an API fails to respond or returns a status code other than the 200-299 success code, the Flink job does not fail, but no output events are generated.
- The response schema with the lowest success code is used. The operation must define a status code in the range of 200-299 or use the 2xx status code. The API node uses the 2xx code if no numeric success code is defined.
- The impact on processing performance depends on the response time of the API server, network latency, and the size of payloads.
- The configured authentication credentials cannot be verified at flow authoring time. If the credentials need to be corrected or renewed for a running flow, stop the flow and reconfigure the node.
- [Multiple security schemes](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/#multiple){:target="_blank"} cannot be combined with `AND` logic for the same API operation. Only `OR` logic is supported, for example, **Basic** or **API key** authentication.
- A header parameter’s value can be set as a literal, but not by an input event property.
- At least one API parameter, which is not a header parameter must be mapped to an event property or literal value in the **Input mapping** pane of the API node.
- String literal values cannot contain single or double quotation marks (`'`, `"`). However, such values can be conveyed in input event properties. You can define string literals with quotation marks in a transform node that precedes the API enrichment node.
- The value of API parameters of type `string` cannot contain backslash characters (`\`) when specifying the value as a literal value or mapping it to an event property.
- OpenAPI can define [minimum and maximum](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/#range){:target="_blank"} values for numeric parameters and [pattern](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/#pattern){:target="_blank"} for string parameters, but the API node does not enforce them. An API returns a response other than a success code (2xx) if the parameter values are not compliant. In such cases, the processing job does not fail, but no output event is generated.
- For API parameters where the schema defines the type by using `oneOf`, only the first type is used.
- The optional `format` attribute provided by the OpenAPI for [API parameter types](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/data-types/){:target="_blank"} are treated as follows:
   - For filtering matching types of event properties, and validating the configured literal values, `date` and `date-time` formats are used for `string` type, `float` and `double` formats for `number` type, and `int32` and `int64` formats for `integer` type.
   - Parameters of type `string` are excluded if their `format` is `binary`.
   - Other values of the `format` field are not used by the API node, including custom formats. When such values are present, parameters of type `number` are treated as `double`, and parameters of type `integer` are treated as `int64`. 
   - Custom formats cannot be treated specifically, as their semantics are not specified in OpenAPI. Check the API documentation you use to ensure that the event property or the literal value that feeds the API parameter contains the appropriate values.
- The parameter names and fields in the nested request body and response payloads do not support the slash (`/`) character.

1. From the **Authentication method** drop-down, select an authentication method. 

   **Note:** {{site.data.reuse.ep_name}} supports **Basic**, **API Key**, and **None** (no authentication) authentication methods. The options available in the drop-down list depend on the security methods defined in the OpenAPI document for the selected operation.

1. Depending on the authentication method selected, enter your user name and password, or API key, and click **Next**. The **Input mapping** pane is displayed.

   **Note:** Authentication credentials are only required for the **API key** and **Basic** authentication methods. Contact the API owner for access credentials.

   {{site.data.reuse.ep_treeview_note}}

1. To configure the **Required Inputs**, select an event property or enter a constant value. You can also select and configure input parameters from the **Optional Inputs** list.

   **Important:** Ensure that all the parameters in the **Required Inputs** are configured.

   **Notes:**

## Enrichment from watsonx.ai text generation services
{: #watsonx-node}

![Event Processing 1.3.1 icon]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/1.3.1.svg "In Event Processing 1.3.1 and later.") In situations where the data in the source table might not offer significant insights on its own, you can use the watsonx.ai node to enrich the events by generating AI-powered responses by using foundation models. It enables dynamic calls to IBM watsonx.ai APIs as part of the event flow, bringing contextual, language-based intelligence into your processing. Currently, the watsonx.ai node supports only watsonx.ai on IBM Cloud and is limited to text generation services.

With the watsonx.ai node, you can perform text generation services such as:

- Summarize unstructured text data for easier analysis.
- Generate personalized responses in real-time for customer interactions.
- Extract key insights or categorize events based on their content.
- Perform sentiment analysis to determine the emotional tone of text data.

**Note:** {{site.data.reuse.ep_name}} can be configured to connect to [watsonx platform](../../installing/configuring#configuring-ssl-for-api-server-database-and-schema-registry). Contact your system administrator if you encounter issues while configuring the watsonx.ai node to communicate with watsonx services.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have a watsonx.ai [account](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/signup-wx.html?context=wx&locale=en&audience=wdp){:target="_blank"} and complete the following steps.

  1. [Create](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=prompts-prompt-lab){:target="_blank"} a prompt in the Prompt Lab in watsonx.ai.

     **Tip:** A prompt is an input that guides AI models to generate responses. For tips on crafting effective prompts, see [prompt tips](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=prompts-prompt-tips){:target="_blank"}.

  1. [Configure](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=lab-building-reusable-prompts#creating-prompt-variables){:target="_blank"} prompt variables, select the model and modify model parameters as needed within Prompt Lab.

     **Note:** At least one prompt variable must be configured.
  1. [Save](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=lab-saving-prompts){:target="_blank"} your prompt as a prompt template.
  1. [Deploy](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=assets-deploying-prompt-template){:target="_blank"} the prompt template to a [deployment space](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=assets-managing-deployment-spaces){:target="_blank"}.
  1. After your prompt template is successfully deployed, open the deployed prompt and copy the URL in the **Text endpoint URL** field from the **Public endpoint** section. The text endpoint URL is required later when configuring the watsonx.ai node.

     The watsonx.ai node supports text endpoint URLs with a serving name or a deployment ID.

 
     **Note:** Deployment spaces might incur charges depending on your watsonx.ai runtime plan. For more information, see the [IBM documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=runtime-watsonxai-plans){:target="_blank"}.

- Ensure that you have an API key for your IBM Cloud account. You can create an API key by completing the following steps:

  1. In your IBM Cloud account, go to the [API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys){:target="_blank"} page and click **Create**.

  1. Enter a name for the API key and an optional description, then click **Create** again.

  1. Copy the API key that you created as the key is required later when configuring the watsonx.ai node.

  Alternatively, you can create API key for a service ID by following the instructions in the [IBM Cloud documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-serviceidapikeys&interface=ui#create_service_key){:target="_blank"}.
