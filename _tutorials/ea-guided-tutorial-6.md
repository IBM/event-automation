## Scenario: Sharing results of analysis and processing
{: #scenario}

The EMEA operations team wants to share their new topic of EMEA orders for use by other teams in their enterprise.

## Before you begin

The instructions in this tutorial use the [Tutorial environment](./tutorial-0), which includes a selection of topics each with a live stream of events, created to allow you to explore features in IBM Event Automation. Following the [setup instructions](./tutorial-0#deploy-the-tutorial) to deploy the demo environment gives you a complete instance of IBM Event Automation that you can use to follow this tutorial for yourself.

### Versions

This tutorial uses the following versions of {{ site.data.reuse.ea_short }} capabilities. Screenshots may differ from the current interface if you are using a newer version.

- Event Streams 11.4.0
- Event Endpoint Management 11.2.2
- Event Processing 1.1.8

## Instructions

### Step 1 : Create a flow

This tutorial begins with the flow that is created in [Triggering actions](./tutorial-5).

If you haven't completed that tutorial yet, you should do it now.

### Step 2 : Add the topic to the catalog

The next step is to provide the topic details to create an entry in the catalog.

1. Go to the {{site.data.reuse.es_name}} page for the new `ORDERS.EMEA` topic created in [the previous tutorial](./tutorial-5).

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-5-12.png "running the flow"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-5-12.png "running the flow")

   If you need a reminder of how to access {{site.data.reuse.es_name}}, you can review [Accessing the tutorial environment](./tutorial-access#event-endpoint-management).

1. Click **Share for reuse**.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-2.png "screenshot of the Event Endpoint Management topics page"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-2.png "screenshot of the Event Endpoint Management topics page")

1. Click **Next**.

1. Paste your access token from {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}} cluster.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-3.png "screenshot of the Event Endpoint Management topics page"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-3.png "screenshot of the Event Endpoint Management topics page")

   You can [generate access tokens]({{ '/eem/security/api-tokens#creating-a-token' | relative_url }}) from the profile page in {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}}.

1. Give the event source the name `EMEA orders`.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-4.png "screenshot of Event Endpoint Management"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-4.png "screenshot of Event Endpoint Management")

   Verify the sample message selected.

1. Click **Share for reuse**.


### Step 3 : Document the topic

The next step is to document the topic to describe the events that your processing flow is producing.

1. In the {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}} UI, go to the **Manage topics** page.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-1.png "Screenshot of the Manage topics page in the Event Endpoint Management UI"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-1.png "Screenshot of the Manage topics page in the Event Endpoint Management UI")

   If you need a reminder of how to access {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}}, you can review [Accessing the tutorial environment](./tutorial-access#event-endpoint-management).

1. Click the new `EMEA orders` topic.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-5.png "Screenshot of the Event Endpoint Management UI"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-5.png "screenshot of Event Endpoint Management")

1. Click **Edit information** to provide documentation for the topic.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-6.png "Screenshot of the Event Endpoint Management UI"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-6.png "screenshot of Event Endpoint Management")

1. Add a description of the events generated by your processing flow.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-7.png "Screenshot showing edit event information panel in Event Endpoint Management UI"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-7.png "Screenshot showing edit event information panel in Event Endpoint Management UI")

   Suggested description:
   > "Events from the EMEA region recorded by the order management system"

1. Click **Event information** in the navigation, and verify that the message format is set to **JSON**.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-1d.png "Screenshot showing edit event information panel in Event Endpoint Management UI"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-1d.png "Screenshot showing edit event information panel in Event Endpoint Management UI")

1. Click **Save**.

### Step 4 : Publish the topic

The final step is to publish the new topic in the catalog so that it can be discovered by other teams in your enterprise.

Creating two options for the topic will allow teams to consume the topic in different ways: one option with full, unredacted access to all properties in the events that will require your approval, and a second option which can be accessed without approval, but which redacts the customer name from events.

1. Click the **Create option** button in the **Options** tab.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10.png "screenshot of topics editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10.png "screenshot of topics editor")

1. Create a name for the first access option that you are creating.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-i.png "screenshot of topics editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-i.png "screenshot of topics editor")

   Calling the option "Full access (approval required)" is a good way to describe a topic being published without redactions.

1. Create a topic alias for the option.

   To distinguish it from the second option, `ORDERS.EMEA.FULL` is a reasonable alias.

1. Click **Next** to proceed to the Controls page.

1. Click the **Add control** button to define the control for this option.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-ii.png "screenshot of topics editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-ii.png "screenshot of topics editor")

1. Select the **Approval** control and click **Add control**.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-iv.png "screenshot of controls editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-iv.png "screenshot of controls editor")

1. As we are not adding any additional controls, click **Save**.

1. Click **Publish**.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-iii.png "screenshot of topics editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-iii.png "screenshot of topics editor")

1. Confirm the gateway group and click **Publish**.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-11.png "screenshot of topics editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-11.png "screenshot of topics editor")

1. Click the **Create option** button again to start adding the second option.

1. Create a name for the second access option that you are creating.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-v.png "screenshot of topics editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-v.png "screenshot of topics editor")

   Calling the option "Self service (redacted)" is a good way to describe a topic being published without any approval requirements.

1. Create a topic alias for the option.

   To distinguish it from the first option, `ORDERS.EMEA.REDACTED` is a reasonable alias.

1. Click **Next** to proceed to the Controls page.

1. Click the **Add control** button to define the control for this option.

1. Select the **Redaction** control and click **Next**.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-vi.png "screenshot of controls editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-vi.png "screenshot of controls editor")

1. Specify **$.customer** as the property to redact, and enter **redacted** as the value to replace customer names with.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-vii.png "screenshot of controls editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-vii.png "screenshot of controls editor")

1. Click on **Add control**.

1. As we are not adding any additional controls, click **Save**.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-viii.png "screenshot of controls editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-viii.png "screenshot of controls editor")

1. Click **Publish**.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-ix.png "screenshot of topics editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-ix.png "screenshot of topics editor")

1. Confirm the gateway group and click **Publish**.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-x.png "screenshot of topics editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-x.png "screenshot of topics editor")

1. Confirm that the topic is published by switching to the catalog.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-12.png "screenshot of catalog"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-12.png "screenshot of catalog")

1. Confirm that your sample message and description are displayed in the topic details page.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-13.png "screenshot of catalog"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-13.png "screenshot of catalog")

## Recap

You published the results of your event processing flow to a catalog.

The documentation you provided will enable other people in your enterprise to make use of the events your flow is producing, and the catalog will allow them to create their own credentials for using the topic. The options you created provide a good compromise between instant, self-service access for non-sensitive event properties, and controlled access to sensitive properties when needed.

## Next step

You have completed the guided tutorial. You used all three capabilities in {{ site.data.reuse.ea_long }}: creating topics in {{site.data.reuse.es_name}}, discovering and publishing topics in {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}}, and processing events in {{site.data.reuse.ep_name}}.

If you would like more ideas of things to try in {{site.data.reuse.ep_name}}, we have more [Tutorials for Event Processing]({{ 'tutorials' | relative_url }}), which are there to show you other things that you can do, and inspire you with ideas for your own projects.
