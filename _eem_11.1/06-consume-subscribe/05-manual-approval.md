![Event Endpoint Management 11.1.1 icon]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/11.1.1.svg "In Event Endpoint Management 11.1.1 and later") If an option has been configured with approval controls, you need to create a request for permission to subscribe to that option.

## Requesting access to an option
{: #requesting_access}

To create a request to subscribe to an option that has approval control enabled, complete the following steps.

1. In the catalog select the topic that you want to work with.
1. Select the option that you want to subscribe to.
1. Click **Request Access**. The Request access window is displayed.
1. In the **Contact** field, provide a contact name.
1. In the **Justification** field, provide a description to explain why you want this subscription.
1. Click **Request**.

Your request will be reviewed by the owner of the option.

**Note:** You can only have one request for a subscription open at a time against an option. If **Request access** is greyed out, a request for that option is pending review by the option owner.

## Access approvals and rejections
{: #approvals_rejections}

### Approved requests
{: #approved_requests}

If your request is approved, the **Request access** button changes to **Generate credentials** and you can then proceed to [generate credentials](../subscribing-to-topics) by following the usual process.

### Rejected requests
{: #rejected_requests}

If your request is rejected, then **Request access** is reset and you can submit a new request.
