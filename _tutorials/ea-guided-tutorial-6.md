## Scenario: Sharing results of analysis and processing
{: #scenario}

The EMEA operations team wants to share their new topic of EMEA orders for use by other teams in their enterprise.

## Instructions

### Step 1 : Create a flow

This tutorial begins with the flow that is created in [Triggering actions](./tutorial-5).

If you haven't completed that tutorial yet, you should do it now.

### Step 2 : Add the topic to the catalog

The next step is to provide the topic details to create an entry in the catalog.

1. Go to the {{site.data.reuse.es_name}} page for the new `ORDERS.EMEA` topic created in [the previous tutorial](./tutorial-5).

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-5-12.png "running the flow"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-5-12.png "running the flow")

   If you need a reminder of how to access {{site.data.reuse.es_name}}, you can review [Accessing the tutorial environment](./tutorial-access#event-endpoint-management).

1. Click **Share for reuse**.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-2.png "screenshot of the EEM topics page"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-2.png "screenshot of the EEM topics page")

1. Click **Next**.

1. Paste your access token from {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}} cluster.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-3.png "screenshot of the EEM topics page"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-3.png "screenshot of the EEM topics page")

   You can [generate access tokens]({{ '/eem/security/api-tokens#creating-a-token' | relative_url }}) from the profile page in {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}}.

1. Give the event source the name `EMEA orders`.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-4.png "screenshot of EEM"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-4.png "screenshot of EEM")

   Verify the sample message selected.

1. Click **Share for reuse**.

### Step 3 : Document the topic

The next step is to document the topic to describe the events that your processing flow is producing.

1. Go to the {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}} **Manage Topics** page.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-1.png "screenshot of the EEM topics page"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-1.png "screenshot of the EEM topics page")

   If you need a reminder of how to access {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}}, you can review [Accessing the tutorial environment](./tutorial-access#event-endpoint-management).

1. Click the new `EMEA orders` topic.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-5.png "screenshot of EEM"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-5.png "screenshot of EEM")

1. Use **Edit information** to provide documentation for the topic.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-6.png "screenshot of EEM"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-6.png "screenshot of EEM")

1. Add a description of the events generated by your processing flow.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-7.png "screenshot of EEM"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-7.png "screenshot of EEM")

   Suggested description:
   > "Events from the EMEA region recorded by the order management system"

1. Click **Save**.

### Step 4 : Publish the topic

The final step is to publish the new topic in the catalog so that it can be discovered by other teams in your enterprise.

1. Click the **Create option** button in the **Options** tab.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10.png "screenshot of topics editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10.png "screenshot of topics editor")

1. Create a name for the access option that you are creating.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-i.png "screenshot of topics editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-i.png "screenshot of topics editor")

   Calling the option "Self service" is a good way to describe a topic being published without any approval requirements.

1. Create a topic alias for the option.

   As this is the only option, `ORDERS.EMEA` is a reasonable alias.

1. As we are not adding any additional controls, click **Save**.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-ii.png "screenshot of topics editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-ii.png "screenshot of topics editor")

1. Click **Publish**.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-iii.png "screenshot of topics editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-10-iii.png "screenshot of topics editor")

1. Confirm the gateway group and click **Publish**.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-11.png "screenshot of topics editor"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-11.png "screenshot of topics editor")

1. Confirm that the topic is published by switching to the catalog.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-12.png "screenshot of catalog"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-12.png "screenshot of catalog")

1. Confirm that your sample message and description are displayed in the topic details page.

   [![screenshot]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-13.png "screenshot of catalog"){: class="tutorial-screenshot" }]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/ea-tutorials/tutorial-6-13.png "screenshot of catalog")

## Recap

You published the results of your event processing flow to a catalog.

The documentation you provided will enable other people in your enterprise to make use of the events your flow is producing, and the catalog will allow them to create their own credentials for using the topic.

## Next step

You have completed the guided tutorial. You used all three capabilities in {{ site.data.reuse.ea_long }}: creating topics in {{site.data.reuse.es_name}}, discovering and publishing topics in {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}}, and processing events in {{site.data.reuse.ep_name}}.

If you would like more ideas of things to try in {{site.data.reuse.ep_name}}, we have more [Tutorials for Event Processing]({{ 'tutorials' | relative_url }}), which are there to show you other things that you can do, and inspire you with ideas for your own projects.
