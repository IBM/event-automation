## Symptoms

If you have an [integration set up with IBM API Connect](../../integrating-with-apic/overview), and you are using credentials generated by API Connect, clients will no longer be able to authenticate and consume Kafka topics through the {{site.data.reuse.egw}} after you upgrade to {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}} 11.0.4.

Credentials generated within the {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}} Catalog will continue to work.

Kafka client logs will contain the following errors if they attempt to connect with a username and password generated in the API Connect Developer Portal and {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}} 11.0.4:

```
[main] ERROR org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient - [Consumer clientId=<clientId>, groupId=<groupId>] Connection to node -1 (<gateway address>) failed authentication due to: 
[main] WARN org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient - [Consumer clientId=<clientId>, groupId=<groupId>] Bootstrap broker <gateway address> (id: -1 rack: null) disconnected
Exception occurred in application code:
org.apache.kafka.common.errors.SaslAuthenticationException: 
```

## Causes

A code issue was introduced in {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}} version 11.0.4 where credentials generated in IBM API Connect would not be correctly passed on to the {{site.data.reuse.egw}}. As a result, generated credentials are not accepted by the {{site.data.reuse.egw}} when presented by a connecting client.

## Resolving the problem

To resolve the problem, [update your {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}} instance](../../installing/upgrading/) to version 11.0.5.
