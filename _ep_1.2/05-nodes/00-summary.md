Nodes are items that can be dragged onto the canvas to create a flow. A set of nodes with specific functions are available in {{site.data.reuse.ep_name}} to create stream processing flows. You can configure and connect the nodes to suit your requirements.

Nodes are categorized into five sections as:

- [Events](../eventnodes)
- [Processors](../processornodes)
- [Windowed](../windowednodes)
- [Joins](../joins)
- [Enrichment](../enrichmentnode)
