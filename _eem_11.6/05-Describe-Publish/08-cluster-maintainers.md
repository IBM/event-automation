![Event Endpoint Management 11.6.4 icon]({{ 'images' | relative_url }}/11.6.4.svg "In Event Endpoint Management 11.6.4 and later.") In {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}} 11.6.4 and later, you can assign specific [user groups](../../about/key-concepts/#user-groups) to maintain selected clusters.

To manage which user groups can maintain clusters, you can assign user groups when you [Add a cluster](../../administering/managing-clusters/#add-cluster) or through the [**User groups**](#add-group) page that is described in this topic.

The **Cluster maintainers** tab on the **User groups** page displays all the clusters that are visible to selected user groups. You can use the **User groups** page to [add](#add-group) and [edit](#edit-group-visible-event-sources) user groups and clusters.

To access the **Cluster maintainers** tab on the **User groups** page:

1. Log in to the {{site.data.reuse.eem_name}} UI with your login credentials.
1. In the navigation pane, click **Manage > User groups > Cluster maintainers**.
